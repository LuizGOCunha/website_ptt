A simple webproject with custom User model, Address model (linked with User by one on one relationship), registration page, login page, logout, and dynamic templates (Based on user log status). Beyond that, also has an API that transmits relevant User Info.

Simply a test of my skills as a developer.

TO DO:
- create login system
- create user api with restframework
- establish solid automated testing
- dockerize project
- deploy on heroku or similar
